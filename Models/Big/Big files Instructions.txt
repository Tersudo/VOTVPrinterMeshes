Big files need to be re-sized in blender for them to be printable.

To do this, open Blender, click somewhere outside of the Menu so you see the cube, camera and light, press "A" and then press "Delete".
After this, go to "File" and hover over "Import" and select "Wavefront (OBJ)".
Import the model, hit "A" to select all and Export it as an OBJ file again, with the scale set lower.
Print the model in VOTV while still having blender open, pick the model up using "R", go back into blender and export it with scale set back to "1". After that go back into VOTV and put the model down with ALT + R.

The model should now be bigger!
